    "### About this assignment:\n",
    "The main purpose of this assignment is to check whether your programming knowledge is adequate to take CPSC 330. This assignment covers two python packages, `numpy` and `pandas`, which we'll be using throughout the course. For some of you, Python/numpy/pandas will be familiar; for others, it will be new. Either way, if you find this assignment very difficult then that could be a sign that you will struggle later on in the course. While CPSC 330 is a machine learning course rather than a programming course, programming will be an essential part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as part of this assignment you will likely need to consult the documentation for various Python packages we're using. This is, of course, totally OK and in fact strongly encouraged. Reading and interpreting documentation is an important skill, and in fact is one of the skills this assignment is meant to assess. That said, do not use Large Language Model tools such as ChatGPT to complete your assignment; it would be self-deceptive and by doing so you will only be hurting your own learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Python refresher, check out [Python notes](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2023W1/docs/python_notes.html) and [Python resources](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2024W1/docs/resources.html#python-resources). "

    "\n",
    "In order to do this assignment and future assignments, you will need to set up the CPSC 330 software stack, which is Python and Jupyter. For software install help, see the course website. Once you have the software stack installed, you should be able to run the next cell, which imports some packages needed for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the software stack can be frustrating and challenging. But remember that it is an integral part of becoming a data scientist or machine learning engineer. This is going to be a valuable skill for your future self. Make the most of the tutorials available this week, as the TAs are ready to assist you with the setup. "

    "2. Notebooks with cell execution numbers out of order or not starting from \"1\" will have marks deducted. Notebooks without the output displayed may not be graded at all (because we need to see the output in order to grade your work).\n",
    "3. Follow the **CPSC 330 homework instructions**, which include information on how to do your assignment and how to submit your assignment.\n",
    "4. Upload your solution on Gradescope. Check out this [Gradescope Student Guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/gradescope-student-guide/) if you need help with Gradescope submission. \n",
    "5. Make sure that the plots and output are rendered properly in your submitted file. If the .ipynb file is too big and doesn't render on Gradescope, also upload a pdf or html in addition to the .ipynb so that the TAs can view your submission on Gradescope.\n",

Then we can again probe `type(x[1])` and see that it's a dictionary. If you `print(x[1])` you'll see that the letter \"T\" corresponds to the key -19, hence `x[1][-19]`."
